# imaqtpiechart
Personal project on data analysis on pro League of Legends games
# Current stage/functionality
This app currently features a semi-functional UI with a working table and filters that let you find your favorite pro player's stats
# To do List:
In the future I would like to improve the UI, work on more visualization and fix the following errors
- Logo does not appear
- Bar Graph is missing
- Make KP % (label_percent() not working atm)
