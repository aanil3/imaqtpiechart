# imaqtpiechart
Personal project on data analysis on pro League of Legends games

# Current stage/functionality
This is a multi-page app that currently shows a KDA leaderboard (Bar Graph), a table with filtering and sorting mechanisms, histogram to compare the quantity of players with different bins of KDA values and a line graph to showcase each player's individual growth across tournaments/seasons.

# To do List:
In the future I would like to improve the UI, work on more visualization and fix the following errors
- Fix Histogram bin quantity #
- Allow user to select leagues for individual career graphs
- Add a career dataframe to keep track of career stats
- Convert DB to SQLite
- More graphs and data visualization
- Sidebar to introduce team and champ based sections
- Create a prediction model for games
- Add different stat types for career line graph (Career totals, Career averages, etc.)
